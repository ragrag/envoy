## About
**Envoy** *(aan.voy)* is a simple, performant and secure code execution engine designed from the ground up for running code as well as judging multiple test case submissions.
Envoy provides a straight-to-the-point API surface, configuration with sensible defaults and out-of-the-box support for a multitude of programming languages.

## Features
- Secure sandboxed code execution
- Stupid simple configuration for time and memory limits
- Minimal straight to the point API Surface 
- Batched test case support
